# GANs_and_VAE_for_RNA-Sequences

__The data used is:__ https://www.kaggle.com/murats/gene-expression-cancer-rnaseq

_RNA_GAN:_ Is a DCGAN for the RNA data.

_RNA_Variac:_ Is a variational autoencoder also having a classifier similar to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06278.pdf.

Training is an issue as the number of paramters for the networks is very high. Hence, its better to have a GPU cluster to work with.
